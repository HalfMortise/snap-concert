			<ul>Attitude</ul>
			<ul>Music is about the holistic experience: good acoustics, good beer, good seats/standing room, and even good parking.  For him to be able to enjoy a concert to the fullest, he doesnâ€™t want to have to stand in line for hours to pick up his tickets, or to have to elbow his way through a crowd in a dimly-lit room to buy a drink.  He wants a way to let venues and other concert-goers know what features he thinks are critical to making a great concert experience.</ul>

		<div class="container-right">
			<ul>Technological Needs (in order of preference):
				<li>Ability to review local (city) concert venues</li>
				<li>Ability to share favorite venues with friends</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>Frustrations:
				<li>Services like Yelp provide reviews for venues, but the venues are not always used for concerts, and are therefore not always relevant</li>
				<li>No specific site exists where people like him can gather to share favorites</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>Technology (comfort level - high):</ul>
			<ul>Mostly mobile tech, and only uses his laptop for school or Netflix or shopping online.  He has an older version of the iPhone due to his intermittent income, as a student, but he does keep his iOS updated so he can keep his plethora of apps updated.
				<li>iPhone 8, on iOS 11.x</li>
				<li>Dell - Inspiron 15.6" Laptop - AMD A6-Series - 4GB Memory - AMD Radeon R4 - 500GB Hard Drive</li>
				<li>Xbox One and Samsung Smart TV</li>
